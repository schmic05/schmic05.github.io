<h1>About me</h1><img src="me.jpg" alt="michael-scherer" width="100"/>

I am a bioinformatician working in (single-cell) epigenomics. Currently, I am working at the [Centre for Genomic Regulation](https://crg.eu) in Barcelona in the [Single Cell and Synthetic Genomics of Blood Formation](https://www.crg.eu/en/programmes-groups/velten-lab) group head by Lars Velten. My CV is available as a PDF [here](CV.pdf).
